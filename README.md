# Heroku URL Shorter

You can try it here: https://intense-beyond-33447.herokuapp.com/

Just makes the urls more small this app has been made by Jose Luis Fernandez Mateo A.K.A 0c0de using NodeJS and Express for backend, I didn't used any CSS Framework mostly because it's a backend challenge...so no more words 😂 but I've used ParticleJS
This app have the following things:

- [x] An API for developers 😜
- [x] A good looking index page 😁
- [x] Particles because everyone loves particles 😜
- [x] Is open source 😎


What I've used:

* ParticleJS: http://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/
* NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/es/
* Express: http://expressjs.com/es/

If you want to run it locally just clone this repository and run `npm start` in console or terminal
